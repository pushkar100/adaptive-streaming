## `H.264`

H264 is the most widely used codec. 

Some of the uses of H264 are subject to royalties. *There is no royalty for H.264 encoded video delivered for free over the Internet*

Its competition comes from Google's WebM format that uses VP8 codec.

- H264 was developed by ISO & ITU (In 2002)
- It is also known as Advanced Video Coding (`AVC`) or `MPEG-4 Part 10`.

**H264 can be used inside many container formats:**

1. MPEG-4 container format (`.mp4`)
2. QuickTime (`.mov`)
3. Flash (`.f4v`)
4. 3GP for mobile phone (`.3gp`)
5. **MPEG transport stream (`.ts`)**

More often than not, H264 is used along with the **AAC** audio codec (It is also an ISO standard)

**Variations in H264**

H264 has been implemented by many vendors. This has led to many versions. These versions vary in levels of :

1. Quality, and 
2. Configurability

**H264 Profiles & Levels**

***Profiles***

- There are many techniques and algorithms that can be used in H264
- Profile specifies which of these techniques and algorithms must be used
- Profile can be used to create a *bitstream*: This is **important**

*Profile is important because:*
1. It provides an important meeting point for:
	- Video Producers, and
	- Device Manufacturers
2. If Profile is HIGH, the quality is also HIGH, but the bitstream is complex and HARDER TO DECODE
3. Therefore, lower end (low power) devices cannot support the decoding of high profile H264 codec
4. *Baseline profile* is the simplest/lowest profile. Low end devices (Ex: original iPod) can support it

B-frames require a *higher* encoding profile!

***Levels***

- Levels specify the 
	- Maximum data rate and 
	- Video resolution that a device can play back
- Ex: `Main Profile, Level 3.1` means `maximum video resolution of 1280x720 @ 30 frames per second at a maximum data rate of 14Mbps`

Profiles and Levels are most important when producing for devices. Wrong profile or level not supported by device - video won't play!

**H.264 Support**

- Most modern browsers support it (https://caniuse.com/#feat=mpeg4)
- Android devices support it
- iOS too because iOS has HLS support and HLS uses H264 codec (?)
- Youtube, Vimeo, etc all started using/producing this codec

**Quality comparison**

H264 is usually compared to the VP8 code used in the WebM format promoted by Google.
